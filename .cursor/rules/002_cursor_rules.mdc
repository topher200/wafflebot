# .mdc File Structure & Best Practices

@structure {
    "naming": "NNN_name.mdc (NNN = 001-299)",
    "precedence": "Higher numbers override lower numbers",
    "categories": {
        "001-099": "Core/workspace rules",
        "100-199": "Integration rules", 
        "200-299": "Pattern rules"
    }
}

## UI Components
1. **Description** (top)
   - Brief purpose summary
   - Appears in AI context

2. **Globs** (top)
   - Comma-separated list
   - Example: `/dir1/**/*,/dir2/**/*,/dir3/**/*`
   - Use standard glob syntax

3. **Body Text** (this section)
   - Keep under 25 lines
   - Use concise/shorthand
   - Tag files with @
   - Focus on key directives

@best_practices [
    {
        "id": "ui_only_edits",
        "rule": "Make changes through Cursor UI only, not direct file edits",
        "severity": "error"
    },
    {
        "id": "concise_content", 
        "rule": "Keep body text under 25 lines",
        "severity": "warning"
    },
    {
        "id": "file_references",
        "rule": "Use @ tags for file references",
        "severity": "info"
    }
]

**Best Practice**: The assistant may propose changes to .mdc files for the user to copy into the UI. The assistant should not attempt direct file edits to .mdc files.

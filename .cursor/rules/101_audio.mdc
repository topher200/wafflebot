# Audio Processing Rules

@context {
    "type": "processing",
    "library": "pydub",
    "output_format": "mp3"
}

## Processing Pipeline
1. Load & normalize voice memos together (consistent levels)
2. Build voice track with intro/outro gaps
3. Overlay background music at dynamic volumes
4. Apply crossfades and professional effects

## File Organization
- Input: @data/voice-memos/ (timestamped files from Discord)
- Music: @data/background-music/ (shuffled and looped as needed)
- Output: @data/podcast/voice_memo_mix.mp3

@quality_features [
    "Batch normalization across all voice memos",
    "Dynamic music volume (background vs featured)",
    "Crossfades between voice segments", 
    "Professional fade-in/fade-out effects"
]

## Error Handling
- NoVoiceMemosFoundError, NoBackgroundMusicFoundError
- Audio format validation
- Memory-efficient processing for large files

# Infrastructure Rules

@context {
    "type": "infrastructure", 
    "provider": "aws",
    "iac_tool": "terraform"
}

## AWS Components
- S3: Private bucket for podcast files and RSS feed
- CloudFront: Global CDN with custom domain support
- Route53: DNS management for custom domains
- ACM: SSL certificate management
- OAC: Origin Access Control for S3 security

@environments {
    "staging": "staging-podcast.domain.com",
    "prod": "podcast.domain.com",
    "isolation": "Separate workspaces and state files"
}

## Deployment Scripts
- @infra/terraform/deploy.sh - Environment deployment
- @infra/terraform/status.sh - Check deployment status  
- @infra/terraform/destroy.sh - Environment cleanup

## Docker Architecture
- @docker-compose.yml - Base service definitions
- @docker-compose.override.yml - Production volume mounts
- @docker-compose.test.yml - Test-specific overrides
- Sequential pipeline: file-downloader → audio-mixer → publish-to-dropbox + publish-podcast-to-s3

@security_model [
    "S3 bucket completely private",
    "Only CloudFront can access S3 (via OAC)",
    "HTTPS enforced with TLS 1.2+ minimum",
    "Environment-based resource isolation",
    "aws-vault for secure credential management",
    "Temporary AWS credentials via environment variables"
]

## Production Deployment
- @systemd/ - Service files for automated daily runs
- @install-systemd-scripts.sh - Service installation
- @run-wafflebot.sh - Manual pipeline execution

## S3 Publishing
- @src/publish-podcast-to-s3/ - Direct S3 upload service
- ISO 8601 timestamp naming: YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS.mp3
- Bucket structure: s3://bucket/podcasts/timestamp.mp3
- AWS CLI with temporary credentials from aws-vault
